README

This project provides a collection of PyTorch examples for various machine learning tasks, including linear regression, MNIST classification, Dropout, sentiment analysis, and NER with Word2Vec embeddings.

Overview

	1.	Linear Regression
	•	A basic example showing how to perform linear regression in PyTorch.
	•	Lead: Bayar
	2.	MNIST Classifier
	•	A simple neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
	•	Lead: Bayar
	3.	Dropout Example
	•	Demonstrates how dropout regularization works to prevent overfitting in neural networks.
	•	Lead: Bayar
	4.	Sentiment Analysis
	•	A text classification task that predicts sentiment (positive/negative) using PyTorch.
